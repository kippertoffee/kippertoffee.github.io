      <p class="postpar">
        here's a song a i made a few months ago. the first (and possibly last) song have made with only hardware. 
        instrument list is as follows:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> Elektron Octatrack: Midi sequencing, FX, kind-of cello sound about halfway through </li>
        <li> Nord lead 2: drums, "string" ish chords, synth arps  </li>
        <li> Mutable Instruments Shruthi XT: Bassline </li>
        <li> Supa-puss bucket brigade delay pedal (on one of the NL2 sounds)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="postpar">
        it really started as an experiment to see if it's possible to get decent drum sounds out of the NL2. 
        personally I think it is a success, as long as you are content with very electronic and rough/wonky sounding drums.
        i used some tricks on the octatrack to get a bit of randomisation in the drum patterns, so there's a bit of natural variation.
      </p>
      
      <p class="postpar">
        it's the first time i have tried to "perform" a song, which mostly involves wiggling knobs and moving faders. 
        it took a few takes to get it a way i'm happy with, and it could be a lot better but i'm no perfectionist. 
        i recorded it into Reaper in one take, but then added the reversed audio at the end for a laugh. i "mastered" 
        it using a preset on a bus compressor. i'd like to work it a bit to try and get a bit more level out of it as 
        it's too quiet.
      </p>
